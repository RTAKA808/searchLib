## Usage
When the user loads the application,  they are met with the about me page and can see 4 buttons for navigation.  The user can click on any of the buttons to render that particular section in screen.  The user is given a clue to scroll down with the floating arrow to see the content.  On the profile page, there are project cards where there are links to the live project(if deployed) and the github repository.  On the resume page, there is a form for contact that the user can fill out, and they are prompted if they do not enter all requisite fields. On the resume page, there are bubbles that are clickable, with a text box describing the modalities I have experience in rendering beneath them.  In the footer all icons are clickable and go to the associated links.
